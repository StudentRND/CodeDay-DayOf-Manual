Despite what the website says, CodeDay does **not** start at noon -- it starts as soon as the first attendee is in the door. Not only does \(at least most\) setup need to be complete before attendees arrive, but once attendees are in the door, all staff need to be focused on providing a positive experience which reinforces CodeDay's culture.

# Say hello!

As attendees arrive, any staff not working on critical setup \(setup involving moving tables, blocking off rooms, or setting up the kickoff\) or check-in should work on getting to know attendees.

Some questions you can ask:

* Is this your first CodeDay?
* What made you register for CodeDay?
* Do you have any ideas for what you want to make?
* How do you think you'll help out?

Your Code Evangelist may have specific instructions for additional areas of focus.

You can also work to "break up" large pre-existing groups by introducing them to new attendees, and make solitary attendees feel welcome by giving them a person \(you!\) to talk to.

If a line forms, you can help get people in the line excited.

# Check-In

If you're assigned to check-in, you can open [clear.codeday.org/dayof](https://clear.codeday.org/dayof) to process checkins. You can also download the [Android Checkin app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.srnd.codeday.clear.checkin&hl=en).

## Procedure

Ideally, most attendees will have a paper or e-ticket. \(The Android app is only a barcode scanner, and can ONLY process e-tickets.\)

If you have a barcode scanner, just make sure the search box is focused, and scan the barcode.

If not, type the first few characters of the barcode. Once only one attendee is shown, you can hit enter or click the button to check in the attendee. The text box will automatically clear and re-focus after a few seconds. You can also look up by last name, but you should check that it matches an ID.

If your sound is un-muted, you'll hear a tone indicating the result of the checkin:

* A "1-2-3" tone \(increasing pitch\) indicates a successful check-in of a student.
* A "3-2-1" tone indicates a previously checked in attendee is now checked out.
* A "1-2-1-3" tone indicates staff.
* A "1-1-2-2-3-3-3" tone indicates a VIP.
* A "1-1-3-3-2-2-2" tone \(which is dramatically lower in pitch\) indicates a falure.

## Missing information

If you hear the "1-1-3-3-2-2-2" tone, the student is missing required information. If there are multiple check-in stations, you should designate one as the "slow" line, for students with missing information, otherwise you'll need to collect it yourself.

If the ticket has already cleared \(or in the slow station, if you have one\), re-type the ticket identifier, then click the ticket ID \(the long string of letters under the name\). A new tab will open to collect the missing information. Ensure both the Parent Info and Waiver are complete before you let the student in. The survey is not required.

A waiver MUST be collected from each student. If the student is under 18 and a parent is not present, they must send the link to their parent to complete.

## Over- and under-age attendees

To attend CodeDay, regular \(non-staff\) attendees must:

* be in high school, or
* be "high school aged" \(14-20\), or
* be in college, and under 25, or
* have special permission.

\(In some cases, middle school students will also be allowed. Your manager will let you know if so, otherwise assume not.\)

If a student looks to be outside of that age range, please ask them to show either proof of age/student status, or an email from StudentRND support confirming the exception.

Attendees outside that age range **must not be allowed to attend **for security reasons.

\(Middle school students can be allowed at your discretion, but should have previous interest in coding.\)
