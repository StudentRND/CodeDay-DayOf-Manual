Setup starts at 11am at the latest. You should arrive earlier if your venue requires significant setup, you're expecting a large number of people, or you have few volunteers. \(You'll need to coordinate this with the venue through your RM/EM.\)

Setup extends beyond the "obvious" logistics: it's not just about moving food into the kitchen, it's also about ensuring the layout guides attendees to be social. For example, it's best to mark conference rooms as "off-limits" unless the seats are absolutely required, because teams who get a conference room rarely leave.

Here's a checklist of everything you'll usually need to accomplish. If you know what your venue looks like already, you might be able to create your own, more specific setup plan to speed things up.

# Setup Checklist

* [ ] **Load-in: **supplies, snacks, and drinks.
* [ ] **Establish a storage area. **Mark the area as staff-only. Remove all the chairs from this room so volunteers don't hide from the attendees.
* [ ] **Arrange tables and chairs. **Try to create large rooms where 50-120 attendees will work.
* [ ] **Label off-limits areas. **Mark conference rooms as off-limits unless the seats are absolutely needed \(we want them in the main area.\) Block off access to any parts of the venue students aren't allowed in.
* [ ] **Set-up the checkin area.** Ensure people can't walk in and out without passing directly by you for security and safety reasons. Set up swag, shirts, etc. Set up a laptop \(or multiple\) with Checkin loaded from Clear.
* [ ] **Hang signs.** This includes wayfinding \(arrows and direction signs\), after-hours call signs, and the Code of Conduct signs \(near check-in\).
* [ ] **Connect to the projector. **Ensure both video and sound work. Load the intro display from the day-of section of Clear.
