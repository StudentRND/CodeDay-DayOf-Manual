Students, parents, teachers, and sponsors always want to know what happened at CodeDay, so we created a place to show off all the awesome things we do: [showcase.srnd.org](https://showcase.srnd.org/)

To get started, just go to Showcase, and click "Login" at the bottom-right (in the footer). You will see a list of all your events from Clear, and can click the current one.

# Optional: Ideas

If you'd like, you can keep track of what was pitched during CodeDay. Just log in, click your event, and then click "Ideas". You can type an idea at the top and click its type to add it.

During pitches, you can leave this screen up on the projector to show students what's been pitched: just click the "refresh" button at the bottom-right (in the footer) to have it update as people pitch. This can help late-comers.

# Adding Teams

**Adding teams is done by staff/volunteers.** Once you're logged in, just click on your event, and then click Teams.

Adding teams requires a very minimal amount of info: a name and a few words about what they're making. Our goal is that a single volunteer will be able to add all teams in just 15 minutes.

## Team Photos

Later in the event, you can also take team photos. This is a lot of fun, and adds a lot to the event experience, so we really recommend it:

- Find a fun location, and invite teams over one-by-one.
- Ask the team's name and write it down on a sheet of paper, in order. You'll need to associate the photos with the teams later.
- Take a photo in a fun pose.
- When you're done, go back to the Teams page, and upload the photos by clicking on the placeholder image for each team.

# Adding Event Photos

Each event also has a photo gallery; you can upload to it on the Photos page (no surprise). Most people upload their photos after the event is over, but uploading a few times during the event gives parents a place to check.

We'll store the original, but automatically resize a few versions for the web, so don't worry too much about resolution.

Showcase will automatically insert these photos into a wrap-up post you can email to parents and sponsors after the event!
