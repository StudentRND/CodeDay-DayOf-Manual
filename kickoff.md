The kickoff slides are in the Day-of section of Clear, and follow a simple format:

* Splash Screen
* Intro Video \(with global sponsors\)
* Local Sponsors
* Schedule
* Awards
* Transition to Pitches

Generally, the Code Evangelist should deliver the kickoff, and should be prepared to talk about the sponsors \(details about which can also be downloaded on Clear\). Someone should check if any sponsors are present and will be speaking for themselves before starting the kickoff.

# Pitches

Everyone's nervous to be the first to put themselves out there, so when it comes to pitches, we find it's helpful for staff members to pitch a few "silly" ideas to get things warmed up. If you're not otherwise assigned, please line up to pitch when asked, after the deck ends.

If you don't already have an idea to pitch, here's a few suggestions:

* Morganfy Me: an app where you type text and hear it read back in the soothing sounds of Morgan Freeman's voice
* TK

Remember, you don't need to have any intention to build the project, it's just to get people talking!
