The kickoff slides are in the Day-of section of Clear, and follow a simple format:

* Splash Screen
* Intro Video \(with global sponsors\)
* Local Sponsors
* Schedule
* Awards
* Transition to Pitches

Generally, the Code Evangelist should deliver the kickoff, and should be prepared to talk about the sponsors \(details about which can also be downloaded on Clear\). Someone should check if any sponsors are present and will be speaking for themselves before starting the kickoff.

# Pitches

Everyone's nervous
