"What did students make last CodeDay?" is a very common question. To answer that question, we created a database of, well, what students made at CodeDay.

You can help show off what students can do in just 24 hours by having teams register for the CodeDay Showcase: [showcase.codeday.org](https://showcase.codeday.org).

If you have access to Clear, logging in to the Showcase will automatically give you management permissions on your event.

# Registering Teams

Make an announcement around 3pm asking teams to visit the site and register their team. They'll need to sign up for a StudentRND s5 account if they don't already have one, and use the same email they used for CodeDay.

Only one member of each team needs to make a team. That person will see a "Join Code", which other members will be able to type in after clicking "Join"

# Adding Pictures

If you have enough people, have someone take team photos for each team around 11pm. You can add these photos directly to the Showcase.

Go into the volunteer tab, then View/Edit Teams for Your Event. You'll see an list of all teams, and can edit each to add a picture.

# Presentations

Teams can toggle their presentation status in their team settings.

Shortly before presentations, the list on View/Edit Teams will be scrambled and show presenting teams. You can use as a presentation order (or copy/paste it into a word doc and modify order as-needed.)

# Awards

You can list which awards were given out on the awards tab. This will add a trophy icon to each team.
