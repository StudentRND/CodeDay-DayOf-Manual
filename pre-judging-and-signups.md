Presentations start at 10am, but you'll need to start preparing for presentations as early as 7-8am. You'll need to go around asking teams if they're presenting, and marking it on their team page on the Showcase.



# Pre-Judging

Because participants often don’t sleep as much as we’d like, they frequently do poorly at presentations. To help remove that factor, we ask judges to walk around from 9am-10am and try the games individually.

Judges should start arriving around 9am. You should have the Code Evangelist talk to the judges as they arrive to explain the procedures. The CodeDay supplies kit includes a bunch of pens and [judging sheets](http://assets.srnd.org/codeday/judges.pdf) which you can give to the judges.

If you have a lot of participants, you can break judges up into multpile groups and start them at different locations. At least one judge needs to see each group.

If you have a lot of volunteers, you can also assign one to follow each judge group and help keep them moving.

The judging sheets also include space for notes and subjective (smiley-face) ratings for each team, to help speed up deliberation later.
