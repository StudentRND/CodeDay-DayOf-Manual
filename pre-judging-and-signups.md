Presentations start at 10am, but you'll need to start preparing for presentations as early as 7-8am. You'll need to go around asking teams if they're presenting, and marking it on their team page on the Showcase.

# Pre-Judging

Because participants often don’t sleep as much as we’d like, they frequently do poorly at presentations. To help remove that factor, we ask judges to walk around from 9am-10am and try the games individually.

Judges should start arriving around 9am. You should have the Code Evangelist talk to the judges as they arrive to explain the procedures. The CodeDay supplies kit includes a bunch of pens and [judging sheets](http://assets.srnd.org/codeday/judges.pdf) which you can give to the judges.

If you have a lot of participants, you can break judges up into multpile groups and start them at different locations. At least one judge needs to see each group.

If you have a lot of volunteers, you can also assign one to follow each judge group and help keep them moving.

The judging sheets also include space for notes and subjective (smiley-face) ratings for each team, to help speed up deliberation later.

# Judging Criteria

Judges should judge teams on the following points, in order of importance. We’re not going to give you a rubric, so during deliberation we encourage you to start by picking teams who obviously excelled in one of these areas, and work from there.

## 1. Creativty
Is it original, fun, or otherwise creative? CodeDay is about having fun, so a team working on the latest mobile-local-social network doesn’t fit the spirit as well as a team with an idea you’ve never heard before.

## 2. Effort
Did the team try something new? CodeDay is for students who love coding, so a newer team who really pushed the limits of what they could do better fits the spirit than a team of experienced Google interns who built a solid Android app. 

(If that team tried to make, say, an advanced AI chatbot, they might score higher on this point, though!)

## 3. Polish
Anything else which impressed you fits in here. Was the art beautiful? Did they make a presentation? Do they have a business plan? None of these are required, but could fit in under polish.
