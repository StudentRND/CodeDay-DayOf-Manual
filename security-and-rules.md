Before the event starts, you should familiarize yourself with the [CodeDay Rules](https://codeday.org/rules) and [StudentRND Code of Conduct](https://srnd.org/conduct)! As a staff member, you should be on the lookout for violations.

If you see something which you think violates the rules, please tell a member of Senior Staff \(Code Evangelist or RM/EM\) unless it requires an urgent response. They're trained to deal with attendees, and it helps ensure punishments are applied equally.

# Coming and going

The venue should be considered "locked down" after kickoff. Any family sticking around for the kickoff should be asked to leave.

It's important that, if you have enough volunteers, one should be stationed at checkin to monitor the entrance. \(You can switch off periodically, since it's a boring job.\) If you're short on volunteers, assign one volunteer to stay in an area which has a clear view of the door, while still helping students.

Attendees should not be allowed to leave once the venue is locked down unless:

* They are over 18 \(confirm on Clear\)
* They are under 18, and a parent or legal guardian is there to pick them up
* They are under 18, and a parent gave them/us a note letting us know they can leave

When an attendee leaves, they should be checked out on the Dayof section of Clear. Whether attendees can return after leaving is up to Senior Staff.

It's important that all volunteers in charge of checin challenge everyone who enters or leaves. Do not allow students to pass simply because they're walking with purpose!
