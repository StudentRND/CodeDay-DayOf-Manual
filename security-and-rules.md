Before the event starts, you should familiarize yourself with the [CodeDay Rules](https://codeday.org/rules) and [StudentRND Code of Conduct](https://srnd.org/conduct)! As a staff member, you should be on the lookout for violations.

If you see something which you think violates the rules, please tell a member of Senior Staff \(Code Evangelist or RM/EM\) unless it requires an urgent response. They're trained to deal with attendees, and it helps ensure punishments are applied equally.

If a violation of the rules happens, the proper response is documented at [https://policy.srnd.org/](https://policy.srnd.org/)

# Coming and going

The venue should be considered "locked down" after kickoff. Any family sticking around for the kickoff should be asked to leave.
