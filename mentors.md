# Handling Requests on Slack

Sometimes teams need help, but either don't want to get up, or feel uncomfortable asking in case they're interrupting. To improve this, students are able to request help through Slack.

All mentors should join the private \#mentors-\[cityname\] channel on Slack. \(If you have a registered mentor ticket on Clear, you should be automatically invited.\) You'll also need to have Slack installed on your phone or computer, and notifications for mentions turned on -- the default.

When an attendee requests help from a mentor, a request will be posted in the mentors channel containing information about the request and a location. You have the option of accepting a request or just ignoring it. If you accept the request, it's up to you to find the attendee and help them.
