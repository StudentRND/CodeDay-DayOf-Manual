Mentoring at CodeDay is a little different from mentoring at other events because we're not trying to teach students _how to code,_ we're trying to teach them _how to learn._

# Answering Questions

To this end, answering a question directly is counterproductive. As frustrating as it may be, you should almost never answer a question unless:

* It's a "find the button" question
* They've been banging their heads for a long time, despite your attempts to help

Instead of answering questions directly, try to ask pointed questions, and help them figure out the correct questions to ask. Some questions which generally work well:

* What have you searched for?
* Where do you think the bug might be in your code?
* Tell me how your code works.
* What have you tried?

## Don't Become the Programming Expert

A good indication that you're doing something wrong: if a group keeps asking you questions every few minutes.

Many students subconsciously believe in the idea of a universal programming expert; that, after working in the industry for some number of years, you become an endless repository of knowledge. They probably think you're one of those people.

By answering questions directly, you're re-enforcing the idea that:

* you're a "programming expert", and
* they're not, and they need to study and work hard to become one, and so
* they can't really participate without your help.


# Handling Requests on Slack

Sometimes teams need help, but either don't want to get up, or feel uncomfortable asking in case they're interrupting. To improve this, students are able to request help through Slack.

## Setup
All mentors should join the private \#mentors-\[cityname\] channel on Slack. \(If you have a registered mentor ticket on Clear, you should be automatically invited.\)

You'll also need to have Slack installed on your phone or computer, and notifications for mentions turned on -- the default.

## How it Works

When an attendee requests help from a mentor, a request will be posted in the mentors channel containing information about the request and a location.

You have the option of accepting a request or just ignoring it. If you accept the request, it's up to you to find the attendee and help them.
