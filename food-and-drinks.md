We serve 3.5 meals at CodeDay:

1. Lunch on Saturday, around 1pm \(the public schedule says 11 to entice people to show up on time\)
2. Dinner on Saturday, around 6pm
3. Midnight snack at, well, midnight
4. Breakfast on Sunday around 7am

When serving meals, ensure as many participants as possible visit the food area. Efficiency is not the goal: lines encourage taking a break and talking. If your event is small enough, ask people to consume their food in the food area.

Generally, only about 1/3 of attendees will eat breakfast.

# Drinks and Snacks

Soda and snacks should be rationed so that soda lasts until at least midnight, and snacks last until 4am. Assign a volunteer to monitor the count of each, put out more as needed, and ensure you're not going to run out too early.

If you have the volunteer count, it's a nice idea to have volunteers passing out soda and snacks throughout the event rather than setting up a snack area.

What happens when you run out of soda? Switch to water! At early CodeDays we bought enough soda to last the entire event, but stopped when we realized that attendees were drinking 1-2lbs of sugar \(that's about half of a bag of sugar you'd get in a grocery store\)!
