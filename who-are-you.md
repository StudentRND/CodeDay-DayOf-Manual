It's possible that if your event is very large or very small, this won't apply, but in general, we find that event staff fit into a few different roles. You can read through this whole guide regardless of your assigned role \(sometimes when things get hectic, everyone needs to do everything\), but you should think about where you fit in:

## Code EvangelistsÂ®

Our Code Evangelists, being some of the most highly trained event staff, are responsible for making the most difficult parts of CodeDay happen: creating the right culture, making sure students are getting the right help, keeping things fun, and getting the right educational outcomes.

Code Evangelists will generally assign event staff to mentor groups, talk with participants who are having a bad time, or run an activity. They're also the ultimate authority when it comes to rule violations. At small-to-medium events, Code Evangelists will also supervise logistics.

This role is assigned by StudentRND. If you want to become a Code Evangelist, you should email [evg@srnd.org](mailto:evg@srnd.org).

## Event/Regional Managers

Event and Regional Managers are in charge of backend logistics of the event, like making sure food is on its way and workshops happen. At small-to-medium events, these people will often also be the Code Evangelists. They're likely to assign event staff to setting something up, moving something, or picking up supplies. They can also deal with rule violations.

This role is assigned by StudentRND.

We'll call the group of Code Evangelists and RMs/EMs "Senior Event Staff" since they're generally more highly trained and qualified to give direction.

## Mentors

Mentors are there to help students! \("Help" might not be quite what you think -- more on that later.\) In many cases, mentors will be professional programmers who've registered for a specific shift, but you might be a member of the event staff assigned to be a mentor. In that case, you might also be re-assigned to general tasks later.

## Instructors

You might have been assigned to teach a specific workshop, which means making sure you know the material, and promoting the workshop.

If you're teaching a standard CodeDay workshop \(like the Intro workshop\) you **should not** be re-writing content, but learning the standard content!

Outside of your workshop, you'll likely be assigned to general tasks or mentoring.

## Floaters

If you don't have an otherwise assigned task, you're a floater! You'll sometimes have a specific job assigned by Senior Event Staff, but otherwise you should be patrolling the event looking for ways to help make things more fun:

* **Talk to students** to learn what they're working on and what excites them about technology. Talk about your own experiences. If they need help, try to find a mentor who can assist.
* **Look for students who seem to be frustrated,** and try to distract them.
* **Keep an eye out** for rules violations.
* **Clean **garbage from teams' work areas.
* **Report** how different teams are going to the Code Evangelist.
