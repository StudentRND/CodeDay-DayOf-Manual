Once the judging is done, gather everyone together and have the judges present the awards. Please ensure each judge presents their rationale.

Present the main awards first. \(Presenting the special awards first would leave teams sad knowing they won't recieve a "real" award.\) The award order should be:

1. Best App
2. Best Game
3. Top Overall
4. All other special awards

Remember that, after the judges are done, the staff can also present an MVP award. This should be given to a participant who significantly contributed to the event atmosphere.

# Clean-Up

After awards, get participants out of the venue quickly so you can clean the venue quickly.

You'll find that it's easiest to get everything done if you divide tasks between all present volunteers. The following tasks need to get done:

* [ ] Pick up trash.
* [ ] Wipe down all whiteboards.
* [ ] Wipe down all tables.
* [ ] Sweep the floor.
* [ ] Return tables and chairs to their original locations.
* [ ] Take out the trash.
* [ ] Return unused supplies to the StudentRND supplies box, and give it to a volunteer for safekeeping.
* [ ] Throw out or donate any consumables \(food, shirts, etc\). Don't send these back to StudentRND!
* [ ] Note any damage, and let StudentRND HQ know.
