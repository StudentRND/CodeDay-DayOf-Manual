Presentations should start at 10am at the latest. Make sure judges are wrapping up by 9:50am, and ask teams to start moving to the presentation area around 9:55am.

The per-team presentation time should be `(60 minutes/number of teams presenting)-30 sec` and to keep things on schedule, it's important that a volunteer keeps time and cuts teams off when time is up.

If a team has technical problems, skip them and come back to them at the end.

# Deliberation

Once presentations are over, judges should be taken to a side room to discuss awards. **It's very important that at least one volunteer is with the judges to guide the discussion and give information on how much effort teams put in.**

Judges need to give out awards for:

- Top Overall (think "1st place")
- Best Game (think "2nd, in the game category")
- Best App (think "2nd, in the app category")

At larger events, judges can also give out awards for:

- 0-to-60 ("beginner team who made a lot of progress")
- Special Award (anything else they want to recognize)

Staff can also give out an MVP award for an attendee who really helped to make the event special.
