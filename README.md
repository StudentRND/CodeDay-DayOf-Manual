Welcome, CodeDay event staff! Thanks so much for taking the time, not only to make things work on the day-of, but also to familiarize yourself with the event format right now. You're the best!

As event staff, you'll be responsible for helping the event to run smoothly but, for how detailed we'll get about event logistics in the coming sections, your \#1 priority is simply making sure students have a good time at CodeDay. Often that means keeping them fed, making announcements, and running workshops, but it also means you should be looking to change anything which makes the event sad or boring.

# Event staff are responsible for the behind-the-scenes work.

At most events, you'll be working with a Code EvangelistÂ® \(or maybe that's you!\) whose job is to oversee the culture and "fun" of the event. That doesn't mean you shouldn't always be looking for ways to make things fun yourself, but it does mean you should expect to do more behind-the-scenes work.

Specifically:

* Set up the event.
* Run check-in.
* Help get teams pitching at the kickoff.
* Set up/distribute food.
* Run workshops.
* Connect teams with mentors.
* Assist the Code Evangelist in building energy.
* Help run judging.
* Clean up the event.

In this guide, we'll explain the procedures for all that and more! Let's get started!
