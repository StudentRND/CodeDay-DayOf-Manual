Welcome, CodeDay event staff! Thanks so much for taking the time, not only to make things work on the day-of, but also to familiarize yourself with the event format right now. You're the best!

As event staff, you'll be responsible for helping the event to run smoothly but, for how detailed we'll get about event logistics in the coming sections, your \#1 priority is simply making sure students have a good time at CodeDay. Often that means keeping them fed, making announcements, and running workshops, but it also means you should be looking to change anything which makes the event sad or boring.

# Event staff are responsible for the behind-the-scenes work.

At most events, you'll be working with a Code Evangelist® \(or maybe that's you!\) whose job is to oversee the culture and "fun" of the event. That doesn't mean you shouldn't always be looking for ways to make things fun yourself, but it does mean you should expect to do more behind-the-scenes work.

Specifically:

* Set up the event.
* Run check-in.
* Help get teams pitching at the kickoff.
* Set up/distribute food.
* Run workshops.
* Connect teams with mentors.
* Assist the Code Evangelist in building energy.
* Help run judging.
* Clean up the event.

In this guide, we'll explain the procedures for all that and more!

# Who are you?

It's possible that if your event is very large or very small, this won't apply, but in general, we find that event staff fit into a few different roles. You can read through this whole guide regardless of your assigned role \(sometimes when things get hectic, everyone needs to do everything\), but you should think about where you fit in:

## Code Evangelists®

Our Code Evangelists, being some of the most highly trained event staff, are responsible for making the most difficult parts of CodeDay happen: creating the right culture, making sure students are getting the right help, keeping things fun, and getting the right educational outcomes.

Code Evangelists will generally assign event staff to mentor groups, talk with participants who are having a bad time, or run an activity. They're also the ultimate authority when it comes to rule violations. At small-to-medium events, Code Evangelists will also supervise logistics.

This role is assigned by StudentRND. If you want to become a Code Evangelist, you should email [evg@srnd.org](mailto:evg@srnd.org).

## Event/Regional Managers

Event and Regional Managers are in charge of backend logistics of the event, like making sure food is on its way and workshops happen. At small-to-medium events, these people will often also be the Code Evangelists. They're likely to assign event staff to setting something up, moving something, or picking up supplies. They can also deal with rule violations.

This role is assigned by StudentRND.

We'll call the group of Code Evangelists and RMs/EMs "Senior Event Staff" since they're generally more highly trained and qualified to give direction.

## Mentors

Mentors are there to help students! \("Help" might not be quite what you think -- more on that later.\) In many cases, mentors will be professional programmers who've registered for a specific shift, but you might be a member of the event staff assigned to be a mentor. In that case, you might also be re-assigned to general tasks later.

## Instructors

You might have been assigned to teach a specific workshop, which means making sure you know the material, and promoting the workshop.

If you're teaching a standard CodeDay workshop \(like the Intro workshop\) you **should not** be re-writing content, but learning the standard content!

Outside of your workshop, you'll likely be assigned to general tasks or mentoring.

## Floaters

If you don't have an otherwise assigned task, you're a floater! When assigned by an
