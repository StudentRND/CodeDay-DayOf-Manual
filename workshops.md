Right now, two workshops are required at CodeDay, and someone should be assigned to teach each:

* [Jumping Over Chairs and Learning to Make a Game with Construct 2](https://blog.srnd.org/jumping-over-chairs-and-learning-to-make-a-game-with-construct-2-a796f4def9e9)
* [Making Better Games with Splunk](https://blog.srnd.org/making-better-games-with-splunk-975cd2a605ce)

Whoever is assigned to each workshop should read through and complete each tutorial.

# Workshop Room

If possible, teach workshops in a conference room which can seat at least 20. If you only have a smaller conference room, but a large overall event, you can run the workshop in the conference room, but have a backup plan to move somewhere else in the venue if there's significant demand.

A TV or projector is not absolutely required, since we don't use slide decks, but it's nice to have an example up on screen.

# Teaching the Workshop

Like the rest of CodeDay, we aim to teach by doing. Instead of lecturing, you should have a student volunteer connect to the projector/TV \(if any\), load the tutorial on your laptop, and walk the group through the lesson using the student as your "slide deck."

This will also help you to properly pace yourself and reveal any confusion in your direction immedately.

You should also periodically walk around the room and look at student screens to monitor progress. When students get behind, they rarely ask to slow down, instead opting to struggle.

# Non-Standard Workshops

Any non-standard workshops need to be cleared through StudentRND HQ.
